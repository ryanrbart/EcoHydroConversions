Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ryan R. Bart
Maintainer: Ryan R. Bart <rbart3@ucmerced.edu>
Description: A collection of unit conversions used for ecohydrologic modeling and data analysis. The functions come in a several flavors. Some are related to dates (particularly water-year-related conversions), others involve conversion to/from metric and savage (aka imperial) units, while the rest are a mishmash of conversions that I've needed to generate at one time or another.
